Hi there, I'm Callum! My personal things are at [geekveggie.dev](https://geekveggie.dev), and I work at JCWYT ([jcwyt.com](https://jcwyt.com)) with @JonahKC doing Python shenanigansâ€”anything to get out of doing vanilla CSS. Outside coding, I enjoy running, learning French, and practicing bassoon. I can fluently write in JavaScript (ES6, TypeScript, Node), Python, Ruby (the best coding language), and C#. Java too, but only under dire circumstances.  
**At the moment, I have experience with these softwares:**
- [Unity](https://unity.com/)
- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
- [Blender](https://blender.org/)
- [Replit](https://replit.com/)


**As well as these libraries (just to name a few):**
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- Hugging Face [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) and [Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index)
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction)
- [LangChain](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [MinecraftForge](https://docs.minecraftforge.net/en/latest/)
- [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/)
